    Insertion Sort-> Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that builds a final
    sorted array one element at a time by taking each element from the unsorted part and
    inserting it into its correct position within the already sorted part

    Analogy:
      You are playing cards with your friends.->
      You pick cards one by one from the table.

                           Each time you:
                           1. Take a new card
                           2. Insert it into the correct position among the cards already in your hand

                           You don’t shuffle everything again.
                           You just place the new card in the correct spot.
