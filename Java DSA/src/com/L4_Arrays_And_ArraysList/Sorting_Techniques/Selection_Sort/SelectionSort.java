/*
Selection Sort-> It is an sorting algorithm, in this it selects the element and put it in it's correct position

Time Complexity:-
Best Case Scenario -> O(N²)
   reason:- Because even in best case it will check the Max elements one by one that are they in their correct place or not

Worst Case Scenario -> O(N²) if it is in opposite order

It is Unstable Sorting algorithm

If unstable sorting array Algorithm -> [2🟡, 3🟣, 3🔵, 5🟢, 5🔴]
means the order of colours can not be maintained as it was in given Array

Two ways
1. Put Greatest element at it's correct position
2. Put Smallest Element at it's correct position

for example:-
Put Greatest element at it's correct position
Arr = [4,5,1,2,3]

1. swap 5 to 3
Arr = [4,3,1,2,5]

2. swap 4 to 2
Arr = [2,3,1,4,5]

3. swap 3 to 1
Arr = [2,1,3,4,5]

4. swap 2 to 1
Arr = [1,2,3,4,5]

and done
